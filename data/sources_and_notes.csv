","Archival records indicate that sewer infrastructure in lower Manhattan was sparse prior to 1850, and sewer lines constructed before mid 1840s functioned as stormwater drains rather than for household waste. Documentation of early sewer infrastructure is fragmented and not consistently dated. The most comprehensive representation of early sewer distribution identified is ""Map 2: Gas Mains and Sewers up to 1838."" Although the cholera epidemic occurred in 1832, the limited number of sewer lines in existence at that time and the absence of precise installation dates make it difficult to distinguish which sewers predated the 1832 outbreak. For this reason, sewer presence and density were derived using Map 2: Gas Mains and Sewers up to 1838 cross referenced against Board of Alderman reports and Common Council minutes to confrim sewer existence at ward level.

Sewer installations documented after 1847 could not be reliably dated at the individual line level, making it impossible to determine which infrastructure was in place during the 1849 outbreak. Contemporary sources indicate substantial sewer expansion after 1850; including undated post 1847 lines would therefore risk introducing infrastructure that did not exist at the time of the epidemic. To avoid temporal misclassification and contamination of model inputs, only sewer infrastructure verifiably installed by 1847 was used in the 1849 analyses. "

New York Historical Society. ",https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/water-utility-map-covers-all-the-area-south-of-21st-street-news-photo/529324467,"Stopcocks indicate points of flow control and water access within Croton water distribution network. Although areas south of 14th Street were largely connected to Croton water mains by the early 1850s, water pressure and volume varied substantially across the network. Stopcock distribution therefore serves as an indicator of relative water control and delivery capacity rather than simple network presence. 

Hydrants served for firefighting ans treet washing funcations, but were also used a sources of potable drinking water by residents.
