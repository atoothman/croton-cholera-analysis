The coefficient for population density is positive, suggesting that higher density is associated with higher mortality. It also shows that an increase of 10,000 persons per square mile corresponds to about 0.64 additional deaths per 1,000 residents. However, this association is not statistically significant, as represented by p = 0.216, meaning that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. The small sample size of N = 16 can limit statistical power.

        "Population density remains positively associated with mortality but is not statistically significant. Sewer density continues to show a negative but unstable relationship with mortality. Hydrant count exhibits a negative association and is closer to statistical significance than the other infrastructure variables, suggesting that greater access to Croton water infrastructure may be associated with lower mortality when controlling for population density. However, given the small sample size and p values above thresholds, the statistical evidence remains weak. Overall, while the direction of the infrastructure coefficients aligns with sanitary reform expectations, the regression results do not provide strong statistical support that these ward-level infrastructure measures independently explain cholera mortality differences in 1849."

        "The scatter plot of fitted values versus residuals shows that most observations cluster around zero, with no strong linear pattern or curvature. One ward displays a large positive residual, indicating that the wards actual cholera deaths were much higher than what the independent variables predicted. Overall, the plot does not show clear evidence of systematic bias, but the presence of an outlier highlights the influence of individual wards within the small sample of 16 observations."

Its AIC and BIC values are also higher than those of Model 4, and the Prob(F) remains larger. Because Model 3A includes three predictors compared to two in Model 4, this suggests that the sewer variable is adding complexity without meaningfully improving explanatory power.\n",

Additional infrastructure variables such as sewer density and stopcock count did not improve the model.\n"

        "The relationship between population density, sewer density, water infrastructure variables, and ward-level cholera mortality rates in 1849 was examined using ordinary least squares regression across 16 New York City wards.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multiple models were tested. Model 1 included population density alone. Model 2 examined population density and sewer density. Models 3A and 3B tested population density, sewer density, and additional water infrastructure variables. Model 4 examined population density and hydrant count. Across all models, explanatory power was modest, reflecting both the limited sample size and the complexity of cholera transmission dynamics.\n",
        "\n",
        "Model 4 was the strongest performing. This model produced the highest adjusted R-squared value (0.194). Hydrant count was negatively associated with mortality and approached statistical significance (p = 0.079), indicating that wards with greater access to hydrants tended to experience lower cholera mortality when controlling for population density.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sewer density and stopcock count did not meaningfully improve model performance and, when included, reduced adjusted explanatory power. This suggests that hydrant distribution may have had a more direct or measurable association with mortality outcomes than other infrastructure proxies available in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Model 4 explains approximately 19 percent of the variation in mortality rates, implying that the majority of ward-level variation in cholera mortality was driven by factors not captured in this dataset, including environmental exposure, housing conditions, water contamination pathways, and other social and structural determinants.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examination of the residuals for Model 4 reveals one ward with a large positive residual, indicating that observed cholera deaths exceeded model predictions. This ward appears to function as an outlier and may exert substantial influence given the small sample size of N = 16. Further investigation into this ward should be conducted to understand what is causing high cholera rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "While the statistical evidence remains limited, the hydrant density coefficient aligns with historical expectations. These findings suggest that localized water infrastructure may have played a measurable, though partial, role in shaping 1849 cholera mortality outcomes."
